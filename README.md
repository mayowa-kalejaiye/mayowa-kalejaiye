## 🚀 About Me

I am a backend-first software engineer specializing in building scalable, high-performance systems. I focus on designing clean architectures, robust APIs, and reliable data systems.

My work bridges backend engineering, AI integration, and full-stack development. I have hands-on experience in modular system design, content personalization engines, and collaborative international projects.

- Backend: Python, Django, FastAPI, Flask
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Tools & Platforms: Docker, Git, Render, DigitalOcean, VS Code
I approach software development with a systems perspective—combining clean code, maintainability, and thoughtful collaboration to deliver solutions that scale.
