## 🚀 Who Am I?

Alright, let’s keep it real. I’m Mayowa — a backend-focused full-stack developer who enjoys making things work behind the scenes.
APIs? I build them. Databases? I optimize them. Strange bugs at 2 AM? I debug them (not proud, but it works).
My stack? *Python*, *Django*, *PostgreSQL* on the backend. *React* on the frontend. I care about clean code, readable systems, and building things that last.

Recently, I’ve been *exploring how AI* (LLMs, prompt engineering) fits into backend systems — from reflection engines to content personalization.
It’s not just about writing code. It’s about thinking in systems, collaborating with people, and shipping solutions that make sense.

Let’s build something thoughtful.

## 🎤 A Saying That Defines Me

## 😆 Fun Fact
I once deployed a project on a free-tier service, only for the database to ghost me when it hit the limit. I felt like a startup founder getting rugged. Lesson learned: Always read the fine print before trusting "free." 😭
